      <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:14px;">My main hobby is gaming. I play a game called Fortnite competitively and I've made thousands of dollars from it alone.
      I started playing the game in late 2017, which is when it first came out. I have a few hundred followers on a live streaming platform called twitch,
    and I have about 150 followers on twitter. I'm ranked in the top 50 from the west coast out of thousands of players as well.
  One of my biggest moments was when a streamer with around 20,000 viewers started watching me play live. I listen to music probably about 7 hours a day
  or more, I constantly have music going while im playing games, or i have an earbud in during class while im learning. Music to me, is something i can't live
  without. I also bike and wrestle with my brothers quite a bit. A few weeks ago we went to Banff and rode our bikes down the trails. Here is a picture my brother took of me while we were there.</p>
