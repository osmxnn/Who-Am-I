I only just started thinking about what I would like to do after I finish high school. Right now,
I believe I've narrowed it down to dentistry, engineering (electrical & computer engineering), or something to do with computers,
like cyber security, or creating websites and programs. I've loved building structures since my childhood, I used to be obsessed with legos and building
my own contraptions. Back in grade four or five, my teacher started to teach us about circuits, and we eventually built our own cars.
That project was one of my most memorable and fun experiences in school, and it is also part of the reason I would like to go into engineering.
I have a large interest in working with computers, so that's honestly what I see myself going into the most. I have also been interested in the health field recently. I was thinking
about going into medical, but i realized it would take almost ten years just to get the degree, so dentistry seems like the better option for me.
I genuinely find it interesting, the pay is really high, and it would only take a few years to get my degree. The most realistic thing to happen to me
after high school is to just work at my parent's store in West Edmonton Mall until I decide 100% on what I'd like to do. I've talked to a lot of people, my brother included,
who have switched courses midway through their degree. Personally, it seems like a major waste of time to not be sure in what i want to do, just in case
i ever want to switch courses. </p>
