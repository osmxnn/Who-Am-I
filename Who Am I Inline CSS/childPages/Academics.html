            I think of myself as a successful student. I have finished
            almost all of my classes after grade 7 with an 80% or above. The only out of school work I did was assigned homework,
            I did almost no studying, so I believe if I put in the effort needed I can do great in any class. Usually most classes
            come pretty easy to me, but I especially excel in science. Science is one of those subjects to me where after a
            little bit of practice, everything comes to me with ease. Since I was a kid I've read tons of books as well, which
            in turn helped me in english classes.I've had a much higher reading level than my grade level, which helped me do
            better in class. Currently, I have about a 90% average in Science 10-1, which is pretty awesome to me. Most topics
            in school come fairly easy to me, this class for example. 2 weeks ago, I couldn't understand what a single line of
            code meant, nonetheless I write them myself. In just a few weeks I have a deep understanding of how coding works.
            These last few weeks in computer sciences has taught me a lot, and i hope to learn more in the coming months.
