           <p style="font-family:verdana;">I think of myself as a sucessful student. I have finished almost every one of my classes after grade 7 with an 80% or above.
             I didnt do nearly as much out of school work as I should have either, so I believe if I put in the effort needed I can do great in any class.
            Usually most classes come pretty easy to me, but i especially excel in science. Science is one of those subjects to me where
            after a little bit of practice, everything comes to me. Since I have been a kid I've read tons of books as well, which in turn
            that helped me in english classes,I've had a much higher reading level than my grade level, which helped me do better in class.
            This year, I haven't gotten below an 85% in the class yet.
