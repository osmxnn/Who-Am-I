         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <article>

           <p>Hello, my name is Hadi Osman, and I am a student at Queen Elizabeth High School.
              Currently, i am in the computer sciences class, where we are learning how to program and code.
              I have been using computers since i was a little kid, so coding is something i would really like to learn.
              I have made websites on website building sites before, but i didnt do any coding, so this brings a challenge to me, and it is a skill i can use later in life.
              My family is originally from the country Lebanon, my dad moved to Toronto in the 1980's, and my mom followed him a few years after.
            They moved to Lethbridge and lived there for almost 10 years, I was born a year before they left Lethbridge to come to Edmonton. My family and I travel
            to Lebanon every year with the exception of last summer, due to COVID-19. None of our extended family moved with us to Canada, so it has been hard on my family the past year.
